Open the NavCoin Core wallet, and in the toolbar, under `File`, click `Import Private Key`. A window will appear, paste the private key into here and click `OK`. 
If your wallet is encrypted another window will appear and you will be asked to enter your wallet passphrase, enter it and click `OK`.

The private key will be imported into your wallet, depending on the blockchain size, this can take a variable amount of time.


### Note

Make sure you back up your wallet again after importing a private key, as NavCoin Core cannot regenerate this key if you import an old wallet back up. See [this guide](/navcoin-core/encrypt-and-backup-your-wallet) for information on backing up your wallet.

An alternative is to move the coins from the address into an address the wallet has generated.
