### Bootstrap

A boostrap for the wallet can be downloaded from:

https://bootstrap.nav.community/bootstrap.tar.gz

NOTE: this may take some time as the blockchain is around 4.7GB in size

You simply need to replace the `chainstate` and `blocks` folders inside your NavCoin data directory with the ones from your bootstrap.

To find the data directory please see [this article](/navcoin-core/locate-your-data-directory/)

### What is “Bootstrapping”? 

Bootstrapping is the process of adding a pre-synced blockchain from a trusted source to your wallet, allowing you to skip part or all of the blockchain syncing process.
